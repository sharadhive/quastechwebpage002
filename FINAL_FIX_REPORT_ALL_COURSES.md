## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

For each of the 8 affected pages, I updated:

### **1. Component Name**
```typescript
// BEFORE (ALL pages had this)
const SoftwareTestingTraining = () => {

// AFTER (Each page has its own)
const FullStackWebDevelopment = () => {
const JavaDevelopmentTraining = () => {
const PythonDevelopmentTraining = () => {
const ReactTraining = () => {
const AngularTraining = () => {
const WebDesigningTraining = () => {
const DataScienceWithPython = () => {
const RPATraining = () => {
```

### **2. Breadcrumb Navigation**
```typescript
// BEFORE
<span>Software Testing Training Program</span>

// AFTER (Course-specific)

<span>React JS Development</span>
<span>Angular Development</span>
<span>Web Designing Training</span>
<span>Data Science & Analytics with AI</span>
<span>RPA Training</span>
```

### **3. Page Titles (H1 Headings)**
Each page now has its correct main heading:
- Full Stack Web Development Course
