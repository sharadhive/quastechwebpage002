## 🔍 **How to Verify**

For each affected page, check:

```typescript
// Line ~64: Component name should match the course
const [CourseName] = () => {  // ❌ If it says SoftwareTestingTraining

// Line ~363: Breadcrumb should show correct course
<span className="text-white font-semibold">[Course Name]</span>

// Line ~373: Main heading should be correct
[Correct Course Title]

// Line ~383: Description should be about that course
[Correct course description]

// Lines ~167-297: Curriculum should be for that course
// Module topics should match the course

// Lines ~300-306: Career opportunities should be relevant
// Job roles should match the course

// Line ~2084: Export should be correct
export default [CourseName];
```

## 📝 **How It Happened**

**Root Cause:** Template-based development without proper content updates

**Process Failure:**
1. Someone created `SoftwareTestingTraining.tsx` with complete content ✅
2. Copied it to create other course pages (for layout/structure) ✅
3. **FORGOT** to update the actual content ❌
4. **FORGOT** to update component names ❌
5. **FORGOT** to update export statements ❌
6. Pages went live with wrong content ❌

---

## ✅ **Solution**

### **Immediate Fix:**
Update each affected file with correct:
- Component name
- Page title and breadcrumbs
- Course description
- Curriculum modules (7 modules per course)
- Career opportunities
- Export statement

### **Long-term Prevention:**
1. Create a proper template component
2. Use props to pass course-specific data
3. Implement automated tests to check content matches URL
4. Add code review checklist for new course pages
5. Use TypeScript interfaces to enforce required content
